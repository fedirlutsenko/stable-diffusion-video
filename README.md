## How it Works

The above notebook allows you to generate videos by interpolating the latent space of [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion).

You can either dream up different versions of the same prompt, or morph between different text prompts (with seeds set for each for reproducibility).
